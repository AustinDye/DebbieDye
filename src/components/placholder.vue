          estate agent is a lot like the two sides of a coin. There is the
          customer service aspect of the career, and then there is the
          transaction side. Both are as different as night and day but are both
          necessary to be a successful real estate agent. They are integral and
          must work together to close a successful deal and ensure everyone is
          satisfied with the ultimate outcome. The transaction coordinator works
          hard with the paperwork (both paper and electronic), coordination,
          phone calls, and other tedious tasks. The agent handles the
          face-to-face customer service part of the job with the sellers,
          buyers, and others. A successful agent depends on their transaction
          coordinator and vice versa. The agent will show properties and focus
          on all aspects of real estate marketing while the transaction
          coordinator handles the behind-the-scenes tasks.

              Instead of simply working through the closing and escrow services,
              we can help work from the very beginning of the pre-listing
              process and all the way until the home is sold. While the agent
              handles the face-to-face customer service part of the job with the
              sellers, buyers, and others, the transaction coordinator keeps an
              eye on the seller’s transactions, initial contract to the
              finalization of the agreement, and assists the real estate agent
              with preparing all materials such as pre-listing presentations,
              seller’s disclosures, listing agreement. They might also prepare
              the property’s comparative market analysis, research on old
              multiple listing service (MLS) listings, or pull an online
              property profile. We're available to work part or full-time, and
              can charge on an hourly or per-file basis.
